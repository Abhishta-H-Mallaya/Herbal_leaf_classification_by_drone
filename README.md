# üåø Herbal Leaf Classification using ResNet-50 and Drones

This project integrates drone technology with deep learning to perform real-time classification of herbal plant leaves. Using a drone equipped with a high-resolution camera and a fine-tuned ResNet-50 model, the system classifies medicinal plants into 80 categories. Grad-CAM is employed to make the classification interpretable by highlighting important image regions.
