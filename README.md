# üåø Herbal Leaf Classification using ResNet-50 and Autonomous Drones

This project presents an integrated system combining Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and deep learning for the real-time classification of herbal leaves. By leveraging a drone-mounted camera and a fine-tuned ResNet-50 model, this solution enables high-accuracy identification of medicinal plants in natural environments. The system supports research in botany, agriculture, traditional medicine, and ecological conservation.
